# Data Science Homework - Homework assignment for Data Scientist candidate
### Objective: Develop a predictive model based on the provided Order and Online customer behavior data (data.zip). The analysis can be done in R or Python and should be presented in an R-Studio Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. The assignment should produce a multi-class classification supervised learning model to predict product category (prodcat1) a customer is likely to order. Use your expertise to design the analysis and provide a rationale of chosen approach. Once completed, please upload your assigment to your personal github repo and share the link. In your workflow, please touch on each of the following areas:							

1) Exploration and understanding of the data sets									
2) Feature engineering									
3) Feature selection									
4) Model design and sampling									
5) Model generation									
6) Model evaluation
7) Summary of results: 2-3 paragraphs textual summary
									
Note: It is not necessary to produce a highly predictive model, but, rather, to illustrate your understanding and practical knowledge of the model building process. There is no right answer, so you can go with certain number of assumptions about the data as you see fit. However, in case youâ€™re unable to proceed without the needed clarification, please feel free to reach out.								
Bonus: If you can work in customer segmenation as part of your EDA
